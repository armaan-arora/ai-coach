## 🎯 Problem Statement

Achieving fitness goals in today's busy world presents numerous challenges:

- **💰 Expensive Personal Trainers**: Professional coaching is financially out of reach for most people ($50-$150/session)
- **📅 Scheduling Conflicts**: Finding time that aligns with trainers' availability is difficult
- **🎯 One-Size-Fits-All Plans**: Generic workout programs don't account for individual fitness levels, injuries, or preferences
- **📊 Lack of Progress Tracking**: Manual logging is tedious and people lose motivation without visible progress
- **🤔 No Real-Time Guidance**: Users often perform exercises with incorrect form, risking injury
- **🍽️ Disconnected Nutrition**: Most fitness apps ignore the crucial relationship between diet and exercise
- **🔄 Low Adherence Rates**: Over 80% of people abandon their fitness goals within the first few months due to lack of personalization and motivation
